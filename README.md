# **Lab Basic Network**


## Introduction and Objectives

This first lab in GNS3 demonstrates the basic configuration of a small network.  

The objectives are:

- Connect router, switch, and end devices (PC1, PC2, Xubuntu client).  
- Configure IP addressing.  
- Set up secure access with local passwords.  
- Verify remote management via SSH.  

This lab builds on previous experience from Packet Tracer but introduces the possibilities of GNS3. During the process, I added a virtual Xubuntu client, configured it, and connected it to the network. It was interesting to see the differences between simulation and virtualization and to explore the new tools in GNS3.

## Lab Structure

[1. Basic setup](01-basic-setup.md)
    
[2. Secure access](02-secure-access.md)
    
[3. SSH – Xubuntu client](03-ssh-xubuntu-client.md)



## Key Features

- Hostname & IP setup
    
- Securing access (local admin, enable secret, banner)
    
- SSH remote access from Xubuntu QEMU client


## Author's Note

This lab is the first one created to demonstrate my portfolio on GitHub. I enjoy installing the Xubuntu client, connecting it to the network, and logging in via SSH. It feels like a new level compared to Packet Tracer, but my previous experience helps me a lot. It is exciting to explore GNS3 and see the network behave realistically.

I look forward to the next labs, where I continue adding features from CCNA 1, QEMU virtual machines with Windows systems, and network monitoring using Wireshark and Zabbix.
